<p>The goal of this exercise is to take the FedRAMP documentation and incorporate into the Markdown standards and format.</p>

<p>Documented content can have bugs, too, and need the loving care of contributions.</p>

<p>The active and passive inconsistencies to the authoritative sources (ie; the word docs) have been corrected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Table lettering and numbering</li>
  <li>Spacing, carriage returns, leading zeros</li>
  <li>Typos</li>
  <li>Table formatting</li>
  <li>Different font sizes</li>
  <li>Obvious different authors lead to inconsistent styles</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this is <em>not</em> an official government site. An attempt to move Information Assurance in a cost-effective route.</p>
