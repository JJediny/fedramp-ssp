<b>AU-8 (1) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:</b><br />
<b>Requirement:</b> The service provider selects primary and secondary time servers used by the NIST Internet time service. The secondary server is selected from a different geographic region than the primary server.<br />
Requirement:&lt; The service provider synchronizes the system clocks of network computers that run operating systems other than Windows to the Windows Server Domain Controller emulator or to the same time source for that server.<br />
<b>Guidance:</b> The service provider selects primary and secondary time servers used by the NIST Internet time service, or by a Stratum-1 time server. The secondary server is selected from a different geographic region than the primary server.<br />
If using Windows Active Directory, all servers should synchronize time with the time source for the Windows Domain Controller. If using some other directory services (e.g., LDAP), all servers should synchronize time with the time source for the directory server. Synchronization of system clocks improves the accuracy of log analysis.
