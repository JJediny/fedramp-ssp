This repository is for the Standards themselves. 18F maintains [another repository for the documentation and website](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-docs).

The [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) created and maintain the U.S. Web Design Standards for designers and developers. They are designed for use by government product teams who want to create beautiful, easy-to-use online experiences for the public. To learn more about the project, check out this [blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/28/web-design-standards/) and to view websites and applications check out our list [here](WHO_IS_USING_USWDS.md). ## Recent updates Information about the most recent release of the Standards can always be found in the [release history](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/releases). We include details about significant updates and any backwards incompatible changes along with a list of all changes. ## Getting started We’re glad you’d like to use the Standards — here’s how you can get started: * Designers: [Check out our Getting Started for Designers information](https://standards.usa.gov/getting-started/designers/). * [Design files of all the assets included in the Standards are available for download](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-assets/archive/master.zip). * Developers: [Follow the instructions in this README to get started.](#using-the-standards) * [CSS, JavaScript, image, and font files of all the assets on this site are available for download](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/releases/download/v1.0.0/uswds-1.0.0.zip). ## Using the Standards There are a few different ways to use the Standards within your project. Which one you choose depends on the needs of your project and how you are most comfortable working. Here are a few notes on what to consider when deciding which installation method to use: *Download the Standards if:* - You are not familiar with `npm` and package management. *Use the Standards `npm` package if:* - You are familiar with using `npm` and package management. - You would like to leverage Standards [Sass](#sass) files. ### Download 1. Download the [Standards zip file](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/releases/download/v1.0.0/uswds-1.0.0.zip) and open that file. After extracting the zip file you should see the following file and folder structure: ``` uswds-1.0.0/ ├── js/ │   ├── uswds.min.js.map │   ├── uswds.min.js │   └── uswds.js ├── css/ │   ├── uswds.min.css.map │   ├── uswds.min.css │   └── uswds.css ├── img/ └── fonts/ ``` 2. Copy these files and folders into a relevant place in your project's code base. Here is an example structure for how this might look: ``` example-project/ ├── assets/ │   ├── uswds-1.0.0/ │   ├── stylesheets/ │   ├── images/ │   └── javascript/ └── index.html ``` You'll notice in our example above that we also outline a `stylesheets`, `images` and `javascript` folder in your `assets` folder. These folders are to help organize any assets that are unique to your project. 3. To use the Standards on your project, you’ll need to reference the [CSS (*C*ascading *S*tyle *S*heets)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and JavaScript files in each HTML page or dynamic templates in your project. Here is an example of how to reference these assets in your `index.html` file: ```html My Example Project ``` We offer both files, the CSS and the JavaScript, in two versions — a minified version, and an un-minified one. (In the examples above, we are using the minified files.) Use the minified files in a production environment or to reduce the file size of your downloaded assets. And the un-minified files are better if you are in a development environment or would like to debug the CSS or JavaScript assets in the browser. And that’s it — you should now be able to copy our code samples into our `index.html` and start using the Standards. ### Install using npm `npm` is a package manager for Node based projects. The U.S. Web Design Standards maintains a [`uswds` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uswds) for you to utilize both the pre-compiled and compiled files on your project. 1. Install `Node/npm`. Below is a link to find the install method that coincides with your operating system: - Node v4.2.3+, [Installation guides](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) **Note for Windows users:** If you are using Windows and are unfamiliar with `Node` or `npm`, we recommend following [Team Treehouse's tutorial](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows) for more information. 2. Make sure you have installed it correctly: ```shell npm -v 3.10.8 # This line may vary depending on what version of Node you've installed. ``` 3. Create a `package.json` file. You can do this manually, but an easier method is to use the `npm init` command. This command will prompt you with a few questions to create your `package.json` file. 4. Add `uswds` to your project’s `package.json`: ```shell npm install --save uswds ``` The `uswds` module is now installed as a dependency. You can use the un-compiled files found in the `src/` or the compiled files in the `dist/` directory. ``` node_modules/uswds/ ├── dist/ │   ├── css/ │   ├── fonts/ │   ├── img/ │   ├── js/ └── src/    ├── fonts/    ├── img/    ├── js/    └── stylesheets/ ``` #### Importing assets Since you are already using `npm`, the U.S. Web Design Standards team recommends leveraging the ability to write custom scripts. Here are some links to how we do this with our docs website using `npm` + [`gulp`](http://gulpjs.com/): [Link to `npm` scripts example in `web-design-standards-docs`](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-docs/blob/staging/package.json#L4) [Link to gulpfile.js example in `web-design-standards-docs`](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-docs/blob/staging/gulpfile.js) #### Sass The Standards are easily customizable using the power of [Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)](http://sass-lang.com/). The main Sass (SCSS) source file is located here: ``` node_modules/uswds/src/stylesheets/uswds.scss ``` Global variables are defined in the `node_modules/uswds/src/stylesheets/core/_variables.scss` file. Custom theming can be done by copying the `_variables.scss` file into your own project’s Sass folder, changing applicable variable values, and importing it before `uswds.scss`. Below is an example of how you might setup your main Sass file to achieve this: ``` @import 'variables.scss' # Custom Sass variables file @import 'node_modules/uswds/src/stylesheets/uswds.scss'; ``` You can now use your copied version of `_variables.scss` to override any styles to create a more custom look and feel to your application. #### JavaScript `require('uswds')` will load all of the U.S. Web Design Standards’ JavaScript onto the page. Add this line to whatever initializer you use to load JavaScript into your application. ### Use another framework or package manager If you’re using another framework or package manager that doesn’t support `npm`, you can find the source files in this repository and use them in your project. Otherwise, we recommend that you follow the [download instructions](#download). Please note that the core team [isn’t responsible for all frameworks’ implementations](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/issues/877). If you’re interested in maintaining a package that helps us distribute the U.S. Web Design Standards, the project’s build system can help you create distribution bundles to use in your project. Please read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#building-the-project-locally-with--gulp-) to locally build distributions for your framework or package manager. ## Need installation help?

For more detail, please visit the [guidelines on our wiki](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/wiki/Contribution-Guidelines:-Design). ### Submitting an issue To help us get a better understanding of the issue you’re submitting, follow our ISSUE TEMPLATE and the guidelines it describes. ### Submitting a pull request Here are a few guidelines to follow when submitting a pull request: 1. Create a GitHub account or sign in to your existing account. 1. Fork this repo into your GitHub account (or just clone it if you’re an 18F team member). Read more about forking a repo here on GitHub: [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) 1. Create a branch from `staging` that lightly defines what you’re working on (for example, add-styles). 1. Ensure that your contribution works via `npm`, if applicable. See below under _Install the package locally via `npm-link`_. 1. Once you’re ready to submit a pull request, fill out the PULL REQUEST template provided. 1. Submit your pull request against the `staging` branch. Have questions or need help with setup? Open an issue here [https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/issues](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/issues). ### Running locally The U.S. Web Design Standards `uswds` package (the ZIP download and the files needed to use the Standards on your project) is built using gulp automation. To use gulp, first make sure you've installed it on your machine globally. ```sh npm install --global gulp-cli ``` Then, to start, run the following command to install any new dependencies: ```sh npm install ``` The following examples detail a few `npm` commands that alias our gulp tasks and that are useful throughout local development: ```sh npm test ``` This command runs the gulp task for `eslint` and our test suite for the `uswds` package. It is an alias for `gulp eslint test`. ```sh npm run build ``` This command builds the `uswds` package. It is an alias for `gulp build`. ```sh npm run build:package ``` This command builds the `uswds` package, which includes the zip files generated for release purposes. It is an alias for `gulp copy-vendor-sass && gulp release`. ```sh npm run watch ``` This command watches for any changes that happen in the `src` directory and rebuilds the package if any changes are made. ## Coding guidelines The purpose of our coding styleguides are to create consistent coding practices across 18F. The styleguide should be treated as a guide — rules can be modified according to project needs. This project follows the 18F Front End Guide [CSS](https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/#css) and [JavaScript](https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/#javascript). Please use this guide for your reference. ## Our use of branches The `staging` branch is the bleeding edge of development. When cutting a new [release](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/releases), we update the versioning on our files by branching off of the `staging` branch and submitting a pull request into our `release` branch. This helps to make `staging` a place that can always receive contributions, no matter where we are in the release process. New commits to `staging` are automatically deployed to [our staging site](https://standards-staging.usa.gov/). The `master` branch always holds the latest production-ready release. When cutting a [release](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/releases), we create a release branch from `staging` named for the new version: for example, `v0.9.x`. Once we’ve completed QA on that branch, we tag the release and merge it into the `master` branch. The branches `18f-pages` and `18f-pages-staging` _used_ to be the primary release and development branches, back when the site was hosted on `pages.18f.gov`. Those branches still auto deploy to 18F Pages, but will now only contain minimal redirects to the new site. ## Licenses and attribution ### A few parts of this project are not in the public domain For complete attribution and licensing information for parts of the project that are not in the public domain, see [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/blob/staging/LICENSE.md). ### The rest of this project is in the public domain The rest of this project is in the worldwide [public domain](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/blob/staging/LICENSE.md).
