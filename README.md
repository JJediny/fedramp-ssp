# fedramp-ssp
The purpose of this exercise is to take the FedRAMP System Security Plans and incorporate into the Markdown standards.

Documented content can have bugs, too, and need the loving care of hot fixes.

The active and passive inconsistencies to the authoritative sources (the word docs) have been corrected:

  * Table lettering and numbering (unless intentional; hope not!)
  * Spacings, carriage returns, leading zeros
  * Typos
  * Table formatting
  * Different font sizes
  * Obvious different authors
